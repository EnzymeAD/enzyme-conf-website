## Description

Automatic differentiation is an established field that is seeing renewed interest thanks to its practical applications to machine learning, simulation for natural sciences, and the emerging differentiable programming paradigm. The Enzyme project brought automatic differentiation to the LLVM compiler infrastructure broadly used for both research and production, and has been successfully used to enable automatic differentiation across multiple programming languages (C++, Julia, Rust, etc.) and target architectures. This workshop aims at bringing together the contributors and users of Enzyme in particular, and people interested in automatic differentiation within the LLVM infrastructure in general, for two days of fast-paced high-bandwidth idea exchange and collaboration bootstrapping. The workshop format remains flexible and friendly to practitioners and researchers alike; we expect a mix of presentations, tutorials, roundtable discussions and live programming sessions.

## Logistics

Coming soon.

## Venue

EnzymeCon will take place at MIT.
