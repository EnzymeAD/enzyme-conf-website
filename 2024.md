## Live Stream

We’re trying our best to live stream the talks (though our AV may go down). Unfortunately the stream was misbehaving for the JAX/Pallas and Programming with Singular Integrals talks, but the rest will be at the links below (they were recorded, so we'll try to post it online).

Day 1: <a href="https://youtube.com/live/Mju_RAXMYis?feature=share">https://youtube.com/live/Mju_RAXMYis?feature=share</a>

## Venue

EnzymeCon will take place at MIT at the Stata center (32 Vassar St, Cambridge, MA, 02139) on the 8th floor in room 32-G882.

The Stata center is the Frank Gehry building that looks like a bunch of different buildings merged together.

To get to the room, go to the G or Gates-side elevators (they are closer to the cafe and next to the MIT tickets office, a large analog computer, and a large interactive screen). Take the elevators to the 8th floor. The room will be on the left after you exit the elevators.

If a door isn't opening, you need help, or otherwise have questions please email <a href="mailto:enzyme-conf@mit.edu">enzyme-conf@mit.edu</a> or call 703-640-8905.

## Description

Automatic differentiation is an established field that is seeing renewed interest thanks to its practical applications to machine learning, simulation for natural sciences, and the emerging differentiable programming paradigm. The Enzyme project brought automatic differentiation to the LLVM compiler infrastructure broadly used for both research and production, and has been successfully used to enable automatic differentiation across multiple programming languages (C++, Julia, Rust, etc.) and target architectures. This workshop aims at bringing together the contributors and users of Enzyme in particular, and people interested in automatic differentiation within the LLVM infrastructure in general, for two days of fast-paced high-bandwidth idea exchange and collaboration bootstrapping. The workshop format remains flexible and friendly to practitioners and researchers alike; we expect a mix of presentations, tutorials, roundtable discussions and live programming sessions.
