## Description

Automatic differentiation is an established field that is seeing renewed interest thanks to its practical applications to machine learning, simulation for natural sciences, and the emerging differentiable programming paradigm. The Enzyme project brought automatic differentiation to the LLVM compiler infrastructure broadly used for both research and production, and has been successfully used to enable automatic differentiation across multiple programming languages (C++, Julia, Rust, etc.) and target architectures. This workshop aims at bringing together the contributors and users of Enzyme in particular, and people interested in automatic differentiation within the LLVM infrastructure in general, for two days of fast-paced high-bandwidth idea exchange and collaboration bootstrapping. The workshop format remains flexible and friendly to practitioners and researchers alike; we expect a mix of presentations, tutorials, roundtable discussions and live programming sessions.

## Logistics

Denver airport (DEN) is the nearest airport to the venue. There is a bus that runs hourly between the airport and Boulder [(Route AB1 bus)](https://www.rtd-denver.com/app/route/AB/schedule?direction=westbound) which takes roughly 90 minutes. Alternatively, the airport is a 30-60 minute drive to Boulder.

Several hotels are a short walk from the CU Boulder campus. The cheapest convenient lodging is the [Millenium](https://www.millenniumhotels.com/en/boulder/millennium-harvest-house-boulder/) for roughly $100/night. Similarly nearby are also the Boulder Marriott and Hilton Boulder, at roughly $200/night.

## Venue

EnzymeCon will take place at CU Boulder in room ECNT 312 in the [Engineering Center North Tower](https://www.colorado.edu/map/?id=336#!m/432495).
